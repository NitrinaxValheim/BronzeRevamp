# BronzeRevamp
Makes the recipe for Bronze customizable by the user.

* If you want an alloy like in World of Warcraft, set Bronze to 2, Copper and Tin to 1 each (50 percent alloy).
* If you want a more realistic alloy, set Bronze to 3, Copper to 2, and Tin to 1 (60 percent alloy).
* If you want to reset the quantities to their original values, set Bronze to 1, Copper to 2 and Tin to 1.

* If you change the quantities while you are in the game, you must log in again for the new quantities to be applied.
