# CustomizedBronze

Makes the recipe for Bronze customizable by the user.

* If you want the standard alloy of Valheim, set preset to 'Default'.
* If you want an alloy like in World of Warcraft, set preset to 'WoWlike'.
* If you want a more realistic alloy, set preset to 'Realistic'.
* If you want an alloy with a mixing ratio defined by you, set the preset to 'Custom' and adjust the values below it to your liking.

* If you change the quantities while you are in the game, you must log in again for the new quantities to be applied.
